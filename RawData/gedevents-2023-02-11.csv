Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi
HE IS THE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRESIDENT OF YEMEN. ALT...
Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi agreed to a UN-sponsored cease-fire. Hadhrami stated that Hadi’s government agreed to some concessions as part of the cease-fire agreement, including the re-opening of the Yemeni capital Sana’a’s airport. The al Houthi movement and Hadi government forces have repeatedly violated the Saudi unilateral cease-fire, which expired on May 24.[2]

Al Houthi militants launched missiles targeting a Hadi government military base in Ma’rib governorate in northern Yemen on May 26. Yemen’s Armed Forces Chief of Staff survived the attack, which killed one of his sons, his nephew, and five other officers. Al Houthi militants previously reported launching a ballistic missile at a residential neighborhood in Ma’rib city, the capital of Ma’rib governorate in mid-May.[3]
